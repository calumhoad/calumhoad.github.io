## Teaching
Teaching has been a central and enjoyable component of my PhD. I have taught on a variety of courses throughout my time at the University of Edinburgh, focusing on GIS, Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, Science Outreach and Communication, and practical skills in Ecology and Physical Geography. Courses have been both class and field-based - I am comfortable teaching in both environments with a range of methods and technologies. I am currently working towards the Edinburgh Teaching Award, both to reflect on my teaching practice and to gain official recognition of my experience to date. For further details of the courses I have taught on, please see below.

### Classroom-based courses (number of years taught):
* GeoSciences Outreach and Engagement (2 years)
* Principles of Geographical Information Science (GIS) (2 years)
* Data Science in Ecology and Environmental Science (1 year)
* Research Skills in Physical Geography (1 year)
* Introduction to Ecology and Environment Science (single session on drones for environmental research)
* Principles and Practices of Remote Sensing (guest talk on my use of drones for Arctic vegetation research)
* MSc GIS, University of Aberdeen (guest lecture on my undergraduate dissertation, using GIS to cartographically represent avalanche hazards)

### Field-based courses (length of course):
* SENSE CDT: PhD Student Field Skills Training (1 week)
* MSc GIS (and Earth Observation): Research Practice and Project Planning (1 week)
