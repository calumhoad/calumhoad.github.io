## Outreach

I'm passionate about science outreach and have successfully applied for funding, lead the development of, and delivered outreach projects throughout my PhD.

### Outreach experience:
* Co-founder of the [SatSchool](https://satschool-outreach.github.io/) project, successfully applying for £7k funding from NERC to initiate the project and co-managing initial project development.
* Secretary of the [SatSchool](https://satschool-outreach.github.io/) committee 2022-23 and Chair 2023-24, with the committee continuing project development and winning an additional ~£15k in funding.
* Delivered SatSchool sessions to ~300 high-school aged children to date, across Edinburgh and West Lothian.
* Invited by the [Institute for Research in Schools](https://researchinschools.org/) as a panelist for their [conference in Manchester](https://researchinschools.org/manchester-conference-2023/), with ~150 secondary school pupils in attendance.
* One of two scientists for Dynamic Earth's *Meet the Scientist* event on 5th February 2024, reaching more than 1,000 learners from 24 schools and 11 different local authority areas across Scotland.
* Developed a *Tour of Earth from Space* for Leeds BeCurious Science Festival. Delivered online (COVID) in collaboration with the [Unlimited Theatre's Space Shed](https://thespaceshed.unlimited.earth/) to an audience of ~500 individuals.
* Supervisor for undergraduate students developing their own outreach materials, as part of the [GeoSciences Outreach and Engagement]('/teaching-and-outreach') course. To date, I've supervised 7 successful student outreach projects through this course, ranging from Virtual-Reality art projects for visualising technical physics concepts to classroom-based archaeology outreach in primary schools.
