## Drone (UAV) operations
I've used drones extensively in my PhD research. I've conducted fieldwork both in the sub-Arctic Yukon (2022) and in Arctic Greenland (2023) with a variety of platforms and sensors. I hold a GVC and A2CofC, in addition to the Canadian certificate for basic drone operations. I've successfully applied for the Special Flight Operations Certificate for working in Canada and has led conversations with the Danish Civil Aviation Authority in order to obtain the permits necessary to work legally in Greenland.

I've conducted UAV surveys to collect data for MSc student dissertations and have taught PhD, MSc and undergraduate students from accross the UK safe UAV operations for geoscience research.

I hold significant experience in the use of drones for research in remote environments, with both my Canadian and Greenlandic fieldwork taking place ~8km from the nearest vehicular access in rugged tundra environments. Research at both locations used heavy and technically sensitive equipment, for which I successfully planned logistics - with no damage to equipment. In both instances, I flew the drones at regular intervals over a prolonged (4 weeks Greenland, 8 weeks Canada) campaign, interpreting complex weather forecasts in order to safely operate in harsh climates.
