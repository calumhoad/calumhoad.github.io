I'm hugely enthusiastic about outdoor sports! I'm a climber, hillwalker, ski-tourer and mountain biker - and I'll dabble in any other sport that allows me to spend time in or near the mountains.

When finishing high-school, I was torn between following a degree in Geography, or a course in adventure tourism with the aspiration of becoming a mountain guide.

Having spent followed Geography through an undergraduate degree, a job in cartography, and now a PhD in Earth Observation - in 2024, I will finally be working towards my [Summer Mountain Leader](https://www.mountain-training.org/qualifications/walking/mountain-leader) qualification. 

We have a little bit of the Arctic environment that I love and research through my PhD here at home in Scotland. I hope that gaining some formal qualifications better enables me to share the environment we have here at home with people who do not yet possess the skills or knowledge to enjoy it!
