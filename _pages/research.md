My PhD thesis is available here: ...

I am a fourth-year PhD student on SENSE CDT, using optical data from satellites and drones to better understand Arctic vegetation change. In particular, I am interested in the sensitivity of Arctic greening analyses to changing abiotic phenomena and how this sensitivity may scale with spatial and temporal resolution. To date, I have focussed my PhD on the impact late-lying snow patches have on the vegetation metrics central to Arctic greening analyses. My research has included two field seasons, in the Canadian sub-Arctic Yukon (2022, 10 weeks) and the Arctic tundra of Western Greenland (2023, 5 weeks). 

### Changing snow persistence in tundra landscapes affects the detection of vegetation change with satellite imagery

### The amount of vegetation within a satellite pixel can affect our abiltiy to detect whether the vegetation is changing

### Abrupt disturbance events, like landslides, can confuse our interpretation of ecological change from satellite imagery

You can find the pre-print of my work examining the relationship between vegetation metrics central to Arctic greening and fine-scale snow persistence [here](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/7421/), and the graphic summary of the work is included below.
