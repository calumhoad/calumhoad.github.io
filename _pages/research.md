I am a fourth-year PhD student on SENSE CDT, using optical data from satellites and drones to better understand Arctic vegetation change. In particular, I am interested in the sensitivity of Arctic greening analyses to changing abiotic phenomena and how this sensitivity may scale with spatial and temporal resolution. To date, I have focussed my PhD on the impact late-lying snow patches have on the vegetation metrics central to Arctic greening analyses. My research has included two field seasons, in the Canadian sub-Arctic Yukon (2022, 10 weeks) and the Arctic tundra of Western Greenland (2023, 5 weeks).
